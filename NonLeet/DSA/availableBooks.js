// You're developing an inventory application for a bookstore.
// You need to create a JavaScript class, "Book", that accepts a title, author,
// ISBN (International Standard Book Number), and the number of available copies.

// You should provide a getter function called 'availability' that checks the number of available copies
// and returns "Out of stock" if it's zero, "Low stock" if it's less than 10, and "In stock" if it's 10 or greater.

// You should add a sell method which accepts the number of copies to sell and subtracts it from the number of copies. The number of copies to sell should have a default value of one.

// You should add a restock method which accepts the number of copies to restock and adds it to the number of total copies. The number of copies to restock should have a default value of five.
