// You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed,
// the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and
// it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
// Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money
// you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

// Example 1:
// Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
// Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

// Example 2:
// Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
// Output: 12
// Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
// Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

// Constraints:
// 1 <= nums.length <= 100
// 0 <= nums[i] <= 400
