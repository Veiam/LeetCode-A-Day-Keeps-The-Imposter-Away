// Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= first < second <= numbers.length.
// Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
// The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

// Example 1:
// Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
// Output: [1,2]
// Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

// Example 2:
// Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
// Output: [1,3]
// Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3.

// Example 3:
// Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
// Output: [1,2]
// Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

// Constraints:
// 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
// -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
// numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
// -1000 <= target <= 1000
// The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

/**
 * @param {number[]} numbers
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(n). The input array is traversed at most once. Thus the time complexity is O(n).
 * Space complexity: O(1). We only use additional space to store two indices and the sum, so the space complexity is O(1).
